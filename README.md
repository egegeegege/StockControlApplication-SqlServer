 <h1>Stock Control Application</h1>

1 => A login page will be created and the information entered when the user tries to log in will be checked in the SQL Database. If there is a user with the information entered, login will be allowed.

2 => The sign up page will be created. If the user has not created a record before, entering your information on this screen will create a record. If a user with the entered information has already registered, the message "There is already a user with this information" will be given and the record will not be able to be created.

3 => After the login router, a panel opens in front of us and when we click on a menu bar above, we go to the pages we need to go to.

4 => Add product permission will be given to change the products in stock.

5 => Stock Tracking will be a section on the page and when clicked, it will be a page. On this page, you will see the data you have received in a list/table and the user will be able to see how many products are left here. At the same time, when we click on one of the people added to the stock, this product information will appear. Deleting operations can be performed simultaneously on the screen. 

6 => Sales Transactions will be a third section and here we can look at sales made in a way other than the warehouse.

Let the Project Begin Then （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤️～
